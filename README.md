# üß† Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning

# **üîç Overview**

Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection Project! This project harnesses the power of machine learning to improve the early detection and classification of brain tumors. Accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment, and this project aims to develop a model that aids healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

# **üìÅ Dataset**
The heart of this project lies in the Brain_Tumor_dataset.csv. This dataset contains valuable features extracted from medical imaging scans, crucial for training machine learning models.

# **Dataset Highlights:**

**1.File Name:** Brain_Tumor_dataset.csv

**2.Content:** Detailed features related to brain tumor cases.

**3.Format:** CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

The dataset is structured to help in identifying different types of brain tumors, offering a foundation for developing precise and effective diagnostic models.

# üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

Here‚Äôs how the repository is organized:

* **data/:** Includes the dataset used for model training and evaluation.

* **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks that guide you through data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. Each notebook is structured to help you understand the process step-by-step.

* **src/:** Contains Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation. This directory is essential for those who prefer working with scripts rather than notebooks.

* **models/:** Stores trained models ready for testing and deployment.

* **README.md:** This document provides an overview and guidance for the project.

# üìñ Study Guide
